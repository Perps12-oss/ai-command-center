# Runtime Authority Map

**Milestone:** PHASE R1 — Runtime Reconciliation  
**Baseline:** `origin/main` @ `e128a72`  
**Method:** Source + `service_factory.py` wiring only (not plan claims)

---

## Executive finding

The repository has **two authority stories**, not one:

| Story | Status on `main` |
|-------|------------------|
| **A — Execution Authority path** | **LIVE** (wired in factory, EventBus-driven) |
| **B — OperatorKernel path** | **PAPER** (library + tests; not in factory) |

Bridging gaps before choosing between A and B risks a **third bypass path**.

---

## A — Live authority path (verified)

### Evidence

| Step | File | Factory |
|------|------|---------|
| Intake | `services/execution_authority_service.py` | ✅ ~L268 |
| State projection | `services/state_authority_service.py` | ✅ ~L262 |
| Goal queue | `services/goal_scheduler_service.py` (`SingleGoalScheduler`) | ✅ ~L201 |
| Planning | `services/planner_service.py` | ✅ ~L206 |
| Execution | `services/execution_orchestrator_service.py` | ✅ ~L207 |
| LLM steps | `services/chat_handler_service.py` | ✅ ~L320 |
| Capability classify/map | `services/runtime_capability_router_service.py` | ✅ ~L238 |
| Completion / evidence | `services/orchestration_service.py` | ✅ ~L244 |

### Demoted / supporting (not intake)

| Service | Role today | Misleading if treated as authority |
|---------|------------|-----------------------------------|
| `CommandRouterService` | Workspace tracker + `classify()` facade | Doc: ExecutionAuthority owns intake |
| `RuntimeCapabilityRouterService` | Kind classifier + provider map | Dispatch only via orchestrator |
| `ChatHandlerService` | LLM/chat PlanStep handler | No user intake |
| `OrchestrationService` | Completion observer | Does not plan or execute steps |

## B — Paper authority path (Phase 8 plan, not wired)

| Component | Exists | In `service_factory` | On live EventBus path | Disposition |
|-----------|:------:|:--------------------:|:---------------------:|-------------|
| OperatorKernel | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Research-only (ADR-006) |
| PlanningEngine | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | **RETIRED from live (ADR-013)** |
| AgentCoordinator | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | **RETIRED from live (ADR-013)** |

`rg OperatorKernel` outside `operator/` → **tests only**.

---

## C — Parallel goal systems (consolidation risk)

| System | Wired | Notes |
|--------|:-----:|-------|
| `GoalEngine` + SQLite repo | ❌ | **RETIRED (ADR-012 A)** — not constructed in factory |
| `SingleGoalScheduler` + Goal repo | ✅ | **Canonical live goals path** |
| UI `GOAL_SUBMIT_REQUEST` | ✅ | ExecutionAuthority + Goal Dashboard |

Live durable goals SoT is `GoalRepository` only. Phase-9 `GoalEngine` remains in-tree for unit tests / future ADR; see `docs/architecture/SHADOW_SOT_INVENTORY.md`.

---

## Decision gate (must answer before Priority 1 coding)

### Primary — **RESOLVED 2026-07-21 (Answer A)**

> **Canonical authority path: ExecutionAuthority chain (A).**  
> Recorded in `docs/architecture/adr/ADR-006_EXECUTION_AUTHORITY_CANONICAL.md`.

| Option | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| **A — ExecutionAuthority canonical** | ✅ **ACCEPTED** — evolve, do not replace |
| **B — OperatorKernel migration** | ❌ Rejected as authority path |
| **Hybrid without ADR** | ❌ Forbidden |

**OperatorKernel** is non-canonical until a future ADR supersedes ADR-006 with factory wiring + superiority proof.

### Secondary (active — Priority 3)

1. Evolve **State Authority contract** — `docs/architecture/STATE_AUTHORITY_CONTRACT.md`  
2. Mandatory state consumption before Planner (not chat-first planning)  
3. Eliminate shadow SoT outside State Authority  

---

## Anti-patterns to forbid in R1

```text
Component exists → not registered → not reachable → second shadow path
```

No new wiring until the decision gate is recorded in:

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (canonical graph)  
- `docs/audits/IMPLEMENTATION_TRUTH_MATRIX.md` (updated rows)  
- Constitution amendment if authority changes  

---

## Next artifact

Priority 1 deliverable after decision: **Runtime Authority Migration Plan** (events + services + retirement list) — implementation owned by Devin; Guardian verifies wiring matches chosen path.
